### How to run the end to end test
The end to end tests are written in Gherkin and used in Cucumber (js) test scripts.
Selenium webdriver is used to check functionality. So place the firefox download of the link below in your System path directory 
https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html
Then open the folder MealPlanner.EndToEndTests and run `npm test`
